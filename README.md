# JS211_Lodash-Practice

npm init -y             // create a new package.json
npm install lodash      // install the full build of lodash
npm install mocha       // install mocha for testing


Build a simple terminal app that uses at least 5 lodash methods.

Use fake data or APIs you have worked with in previous projects or google fake data you can use. - [ ] Either make a fetch or save it in a few variables.

Console.log the output of each lodash method called on the fake data.

Use at least these methods: _.chunk(), _.reverse(), _.without(), _.shuffle().

Create unit tests with Mocha for each function you build.
